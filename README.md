This repository contains my studies of "Testing Javascript Applications Using Jest".
The first module that I completed was focus to Jest presentation and its basic implementation on a Typescript project without a frontend framework. I used ES6 JS modules on this repository.

**Now I'm studying React because I'll start testing React Applications soon.**
